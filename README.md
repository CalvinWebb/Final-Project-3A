# Bonle: The Human Skeletal System Guessing Game 
## by Calvin Webb, Sawyer Murdock, and Isabelle Davis
Bonle is a guessing game where you guess bones in the human skeletal system and if the bone you guessed isnt the target bone, it will turn a certain shade of red. Darker/More red means that its **closer** to the target bone, and Lighter/Less red means that it is **farther** from the target bone. 
<br /> The files in this GitHub are the base scripts that are used via Unity and some of the assets present in the game.(If you want to see all the assets there is a folder in the zipped folder that I have a link to)
